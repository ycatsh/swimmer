# Visualizing Genetic Algorithm
trained an agent to learn how to swim via a genetic algorithm 

## Teaching an Agent How to Swim
This algorithm trains an agent to learn how to swim via a genetics, that includes, mutation and crossovers enabling the agents to progressively learn.

### Target
Speed: 1 m/s  
Distance: 1000 m   
Time: $1000\div{1} = 1000 s$
